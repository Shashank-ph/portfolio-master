                    <b>Why is cybersecurity a global issue and why should companies invest in it?</b><br>

                    Cybercrime constitutes to nearly half of all crimes, yet any law enforcement agency allocates just
                    less than 1% of their budgets in combatting it. Modern cybercrime, evolving from small-scale frauds
                    to organized underground markets since 2003, stresses on the need for comprehensive understanding
                    and resource allocation for Cyber Security (Anderson, 2020). Cybersecurity is the need of the hour
                    which aids in fortifying defences of any organisation from disclosing sensitive data to protecting
                    reputational value of the company.<span id="dots"></span>
                    <span id="more">

                      Ransomware-as-a-service has been on the rise especially since the pandemic, which has resulted in
                      the loss of millions of dollars for the ransomware victims (Anderson, 2020). The NotPetya and
                      Stuxnet worm, the hacks behind Office of Personnel Management (OPM) of The White House have proved
                      us time and again that these aren’t just random hackings but are considered as an act of war
                      against
                      countries (Anderson, 2020). In digital times like these, frameworks such as GDPR, NIST, ISO 27001
                      &
                      others ensures standardized practices, compliance with legal requirements, effective risk
                      management, and enhanced customer trust and operational efficiency (Alshar’e, 2023).
                      Even when implementing cybersecurity protocols & frameworks is never completely foolproof,
                      recognizing the risks is the first step for any company in this interconnected world. Moreover,
                      accepting current vulnerabilities and taking protective measures against them is what counts.
                      Given
                      the complexity of the cyber world, continuous readiness and improvement through technology are
                      crucial (VanSyckel, 2018). Therefore, investing in robust cybersecurity is essential for
                      mitigating
                      risks and securing a company's future in an increasingly digital world.

                    <b>Peer Response for Khalil</b><br>
                    I completely agree with your points Khalil. Companies must invest in cybersecurity as a
                    precautionary measure rather than paying the legal fines after being scrutinised. We live in a
                    digitally connected world where the need for cyber security is prevalent, and the risks of
                    cybercrime have long-lasting effects not only on an individual level but also on a larger scale with
                    many government agencies. Negrea Petru-Cristian (2023) states that international relations which
                    once focused on territorial sovereignty and military strength, are now shifting towards cyber
                    conflicts and digital espionage that sabotages everyone.<span id="dots1"></span>
                    <span id="more1">
                      I think that in addition to GDPR and CCPA, other frameworks, such as NIST or ISO 27001, would also
                      be worth considering, as they support broader control over cyber security measures. We are already
                      at that stage where it's important to remember that cyber security isn’t a one-time activity but a
                      continual process. This ongoing effort needs to be aided by additional countermeasures such as
                      conducting appropriate risk assessments, vulnerability assessments, internal audits and routine
                      security configuration reviews to maintain our cyber defences.
                      To conclude, I agree that cyber security is no longer a “nice to have” but a primary requirement
                      for
                      any organization. Enabling robust cybersecurity protocols not only prevents potential disruptions
                      but also enables organizations to innovate confidently, knowing that their digital infrastructure
                      is
                      secure. <br>

                      Studies and Implications’. Available at: https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.17461.65763.<br><br>


                      <b>Peer Response for Ketan</b><br>
                      Cybersecurity is a global issue due to the increasing complexity and interconnectedness of digital
                      systems, which create a growing landscape for cyber threats. As businesses and governments rely
                      more
                      on digital platforms, cybersecurity breaches can have widespread economic, social, and political
                      ramifications, affecting national security and global economic stability.
                      Investing in cybersecurity provides significant economic benefits by protecting against data
                      breaches that can lead to substantial financial losses through theft and reputational damage.
                      According to IBM Security (2024), the average cost of a data breach is $4.88 million, including
                      expenses related to incident response, legal actions, and customer loss. Companies can mitigate
                      these costs and ensure business continuity by investing in cybersecurity.
                      Compliance with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European
                      Union
                      is crucial. Non-compliance can result in hefty fines and reputational damage, leading to a loss of
                      trust among customers and partners. Strong cybersecurity practices help organizations
                      differentiate
                      themselves in the market by building trust with stakeholders.
                      Amazon exemplifies the importance of cybersecurity by investing heavily in protecting its
                      infrastructure and maintaining customer trust. Its subsidiary, Amazon Web Services (AWS), offers
                      robust security features and compliance certifications, demonstrating the value of cybersecurity
                      investment in business strategy.<br><br>

                      <b>Peer Response for Almaha</b><br>

                      I fully support the points you've raised regarding the significance of cybersecurity for
                      businesses.
                      In the current era of digitization, companies of all sizes face substantial risks of cyberattacks,
                      which can have severe consequences. Safeguarding sensitive information, such as customer data,
                      business plans, and confidential knowledge like Coca-Cola's secret formula, is essential for
                      upholding a company's reputation and integrity. Additional examples to consider include the
                      original
                      recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and McDonald’s Big Mac Special Sauce.

                      Investing in cybersecurity is no longer a precaution but a necessity. As you accurately pointed
                      out,
                      the costs associated with addressing a data breach far exceed the investment in a robust
                      cybersecurity infrastructure. Furthermore, gaining consumer trust is an important asset. Once it
                      is
                      lost due to a security breach, it can be extremely challenging to regain the customer's
                      confidence.
                      Adhering to data protection regulations such as GDPR is exceptionally crucial in such scenarios
                      and
                      failing to comply can lead to significant fines and legal repercussions.

                      In an increasingly competitive market, companies that prioritize cybersecurity gain a considerable
                      advantage over other organizations. Customers are more inclined to trust and engage with companies
                      known for taking their security seriously. In conclusion, robust cybersecurity measures help
                      businesses in preventing costly incidents, maintain customer trust, adhere to legal requirements
                      while staying ahead of the competition.<br><br>


                      <b>Peer Response for Mohsen</b><br>

                      You have made a good point Mohsen. The importance of cybersecurity in today's digital landscape
                      cannot be overstated, especially as organizations increasingly rely on advanced technologies to
                      drive their business growth. Increasing digital infrastructure and online connectivity expands
                      with
                      attack surface making businesses more vulnerable to cyber threats. The complexity of securing
                      networks, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring the integrity of digital assets demands
                      continuous
                      investment in robust cybersecurity measures. The consequences of a successful cyber-attack such as
                      financial and reputational damage, hefty penalties highlight the critical need for cybersecurity
                      mechanisms. You have made this point clear with the example of the 2017 Equifax data breach which
                      exposed the personal information of millions and resulted in significant financial settlements.
                      In addition to protecting against immediate threats, adhering to cybersecurity regulations and
                      laws
                      like GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, NIST and PCI-DSS is crucial for maintaining a strong security posture and
                      avoiding hefty fines. Compliance not only helps prevent legal repercussions but also ensures that
                      organizations can continue to operate within regulated industries without facing operational
                      disruptions. The evolving threat landscape characterized by sophisticated attacks and emerging
                      risks
                      further details the need for ongoing vigilance and investment in cybersecurity. Moreover,
                      cybersecurity is essential for enabling innovation and sustaining business growth in a safe and
                      secure environment. By investing in comprehensive cybersecurity frameworks, organizations can
                      confidently explore new technologies, expand their digital capabilities, and ensure business
                      continuity in the longer run.

                  <p class="body-sm">

                    In the increasingly interconnected digital world, cybersecurity is of paramount importance for any
                    organization. The alarming statistics of cyber-attacks underscore the need for companies to take
                    cybersecurity seriously, as these threats have evolved from targeting small to medium-scale
                    companies to government agencies and charities.<span id="dots2"></span>
                    <span id="more2">
                      Cybersecurity breaches have huge financial
                      implications for any organization. These firms face additional penalties, loss of data,
                      reputational
                      damage, and operational disruption (Vaidya, 2019). Investing in cybersecurity is crucial for
                      companies of all sizes because cyber threats can have severe consequences. As the digital
                      landscape
                      continues to evolve, every company, regardless of its size, becomes a potential target for
                      cyberattacks (Li and Liu, 2021).

                      However, heavily investing in cybersecurity may not be feasible for all companies, especially
                      smaller businesses or startups with limited resources. For example, small-scale companies within
                      Australia often face tight budgets and struggle to allocate significant funds toward comprehensive
                      cybersecurity measures. The challenge lies in balancing the need for protection with the
                      technical,
                      financial, legal & organizational constraints that smaller companies face (Tam, Rao and Hall,
                      2021).

                      In such cases, micro and small businesses must perform a risk-based analysis to investigate
                      cybersecurity. This involves prioritizing critical assets and vulnerabilities, adopting various
                      compliance frameworks, investing in cost-effective solutions and leveraging outsourced services
                      where feasible. By focusing on the most significant threats and adopting scalable solutions, even
                      smaller companies can achieve a reasonable level of security without exceeding their budgets.

                      It is evident that strengthening a company's growth depends on understanding the changing nature
                      of
                      cyber threats and the significance of staying vigilant. By prioritizing cybersecurity as a core
                      element of strategic planning, companies can adequately manage the complexities of the digital era
                      and ensure their success in the long term. In conclusion, investing in robust cybersecurity
                      measures
                      is crucial for any organization not just for protecting data but also for securing the company's
                      future.<br><br>
