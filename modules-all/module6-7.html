                    <b>Word Count: 948 (excluding references)</b><br><br>
                    <b>Introduction:</b><br> In the Security and Risk Management module, I participated in a range of
                    activities
                    designed to build expertise in identifying, analysing, and mitigating risks in information systems.
                    These included theoretical discussions, practical exercises like vulnerability assessments, and
                    collaborative projects, such as the Pampered Pets digitalisation initiative in Units 6 to 11.
                    Adopting Rolfe et al.’s (2001) reflective framework, What (description), So What (analysis), and Now
                    What (future actions), I will reflect on the risk management process, my individual contributions to
                    team activities, my experiences in a development team, and the module's influence on my professional
                    and personal development. This reflection draws on artefacts, collaborative discussions, peer
                    feedback, and self-evaluation to illustrate my growth, aligning with the module's learning outcomes
                    on critical risk analysis and ethical considerations.

                    <br><br>
                    <span id="dots"></span>
                    <span id="more">

                      <b>Risk Management Process (What, So What):</b><br> The module provided a structured introduction
                      to risk
                      management, emphasising identification of threats, vulnerability analysis, and mitigation
                      strategies within the current threat landscape. Early on, in Unit 2, I reviewed a case study,
                      focusing on the Role of AI in Risk Management. By Unit 7, I applied this learning to evaluate risk
                      and threat handling in international supply chain organisations, recognising how digitalisation
                      risks could expose sensitive data. In the Pampered Pets project, I used Monte Carlo simulations to
                      quantify supply chain risks, such as finding the probability of quality degradation from
                      suppliers.<br><br>

                      <b>Analysing this progression (So What):</b><br> I realised my initial challenges stemmed from a
                      reliance on
                      surface-level intuition rather than evidence-based synthesis. The module compelled me to gather
                      information from sources like OWASP Top Ten (2025) for categorising vulnerabilities, such as
                      insecure authentication in applications, and Verizon’s (2025) Data Breach Investigations Report
                      for phishing trends, to name a few. This shift fostered critical thinking, as I learned to
                      articulate business impacts, like data exposure leading to GDPR breaches. In the early stages, it
                      made me feel inadequate, but they motivated deeper engagement, enhancing my ability to apply
                      methodologies like CVSS or SSVC scoring to prioritise risks. This process underscored the ethical
                      responsibilities of security professionals, as per the Joint Task Force Interagency Working Group
                      (2020), in balancing technical solutions with legal and social implications.<br><br>

                      <b>Individual Contributions to Team Activities (What, So What):</b><br> My key contributions
                      centred on risk
                      evaluation in group projects. In the Pampered Pets initiative, I was responsible for assessing
                      digitalisation risks and mitigations, including international supply chain vulnerabilities and
                      business continuity strategies. I produced a section on risk evaluation and mitigation. Artefacts,
                      such as my risk matrix and simulation outputs, demonstrate this, alongside peer evaluation where
                      team members rated my work quality and contributions as above average (4/5). However,
                      self-evaluation revealed I sometimes underestimated delegation, scoring myself 4/5 on
                      initiative.<br><br>

                      <b>Reflecting on these (So What):</b><br> I felt a mix of pride and overwhelm; leading the risk
                      analysis
                      boosted my confidence, but conflicting opinions on prioritisation caused anxiety about meeting
                      word limits. Peer feedback praised my cooperative attitude, aligning with my strengths in clear
                      communication and reliability, as noted in the evaluation template. This experience highlighted
                      how my proactive problem-solving, such as aligning my findings to avoid any overlap, contributed
                      to team success. Yet, it exposed a need for better task distribution, as early underestimation of
                      effort led to rushed revisions. Drawing on prior solo experiences, like analysing OWASP
                      vulnerabilities, I learned to integrate creative input with structured delegation, refining my
                      collaboration skills and reinforcing the value of individual accountability in group
                      outcomes.<br><br>

                      <b>Teamwork Experience (What, So What):</b><br> By working in a four-member group, I experienced
                      the dynamics
                      of virtual collaboration in development projects. We resolved these issues with regular meetings,
                      maintaining alignment despite time zone challenges. The peer evaluation template captured this by
                      providing ratings for attendance and discussions, as well as a self-score for cooperation, which
                      reflects active listening.<br><br>

                      <b>Examining this (So What):</b><br> The group activity experience evoked frustration from
                      clashing views,
                      rooted in my desire for control, but it taught emotional resilience and the benefits of diverse
                      perspectives. Belbin's (2010) team roles helped me identify as a 'Shaper', who pushes for progress
                      but sometimes dominates. Positive behaviours, such as timely completions were valuable, while
                      rare, delayed communications due to scheduling conflicts temporarily hindered momentum, as noted
                      in feedback. This reinforced the collaborative essence of security work, where synthesising inputs
                      from multiple sources leads to robust solutions. Overall, it improved my conflict resolution and
                      adaptability, essential for ethical team practices in high-stakes environments like critical
                      infrastructure protection.<br><br>

                      <b>Professional and Personal Development (What, So What, Now What):</b><br> The module has
                      enhanced my
                      technical proficiency. Personally, it improved time management, as evidenced by meeting Pampered
                      Pets' deadlines after initial setbacks, and boosted confidence in presenting ethical analyses,
                      like AI governance frameworks from Kumar et al. (2025).<br><br>

                      <b>Analysing the impact (So What):</b><br> These experiences transformed my reactive mindset into
                      a proactive
                      one, emphasising legal and social issues in security. Researching AI ethics through UNESCO (2021)
                      reshaped my vision toward roles in secure software development. Emotionally, overcoming struggles
                      built resilience, while peer praise for supportive attitudes affirmed my growth in
                      empathy.<br><br>

                      <b>Looking ahead (Now What):</b><br> I will apply these insights by pursuing the ISO 27001 Lead
                      Auditor
                      certification, which I will add to my PDP. To address areas for improvement, such as active
                      participation, I plan to seek diverse team roles in future projects. Continued reflection using
                      Rolfe's model will ensure I refine delegation and adaptability, preparing me for real-world
                      challenges in information security.<br><br>

                      <b>Conclusion:</b><br> This module has profoundly shaped my abilities, from risk analysis to
                      ethical
                      teamwork. Through Rolfe's framework, I've pinpointed growth areas, supported by artefacts and
                      feedback, and committed to ongoing development. These skills will propel my career, with the
                      e-portfolio evidencing my journey toward becoming a competent security professional.<br><br>
