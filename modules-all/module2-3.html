                  <p class="body-sm">

                    Using the website(s) assigned to you in Unit 1, carry out the following exercise and answer the
                    questions listed below.

                    <b>Instructions</b><br>
                    Perform scans against your assigned website(s) using the tools available in Kali Linux. Answer as
                    many of the following questions as you can:<br><br>

                    • What Operating System does the website utilise?<br>
                    • What web server software is it running?<br>
                    • Is it running a CMS (Wordpress, Drupal, etc?)<br>
                    • What protection does it have (CDN, Proxy, Firewall?)<br>
                    • Where is it hosted?<br>
                    • Does it have any open ports? Which did you expect to be open?<br>
                    • Does the site have any known vulnerabilities?<br>
                    • What versions of software is it using? Are these patched so that they are up to date?
                    <br><br>
                    <span id="dots"></span>
                    <span id="more">

                      The wiki should consist of two sections:

                      The first section should be a FAQ (frequently asked questions) where you can post questions. In
                      addition, if you have encountered and solved any of the questions/ issues, you should post your
                      responses to the queries.
                      The second section involves the results - each of you should post a compilation of the results
                      they have obtained in the wiki. Doing so will allow your fellow students to evaluate the kind of
                      results available and ask questions (in the FAQ section) about how certain results were obtained.
                      Offer constructive feedback on the results posted.<br><br>
                      <b>Learning Outcomes</b><br>
                      Identify and analyse security threats and vulnerabilities in network systems and determine
                      appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to manage and/or solve them.
                      Design and critically appraise computer programs and systems to produce solutions that help manage
                      and audit risk and security issues.
                      Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including internet security alerts and
                      warning sites) to aid in the systematic analysis of security breaches and issues.<br><br>
                      <b>Reflection</b> Reflect on this activity by answering the following questions:<br>

                      • Did you have any issues or challenges with the scans?<br>
                      • How did you overcome them?<br>
                      • How will they affect your final report?<br><br>
                      Record all reflections in your e-portfolio.

                  <p class="body-sm">

                    <b>• How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?<br></b>
                    ‣‣‣ 30 hops from base machine to the assigned website (https://ginandjuice.shop)<br><br>

                    <b>• Which step causes the biggest delay in the route? What is the average duration of that
                      delay?<br></b>
                    ‣‣‣ 150 ms * * if-bundle-2-2.qcore2.mlv-mumbai.as6453.net [209.58.105.0]<br>
                    ‣‣‣ The above step caused the biggest delay in the route. The average duration of that delay is
                    135ms.<br><br>

                    <b>• What are the main nameservers for the website?<br></b>

                      <b>• What is the MX record for the website?</b><br>
                      ‣‣‣ No MX record was found<br><br>

                      <b>• Where is the website hosted?</b><br>
                      ‣‣‣ 34.249.203.140, Ireland<br>
                      ‣‣‣ 34.246.169.176, Ireland<br><br>

                      <b>Reflection</b><br>
                      <b>• Did you have any issues or challenges with the scans?</b><br>
                      ‣‣‣ Initially, tracert gave the error as I had also given “https” & “www” in the prompt.<br>
                      ‣‣‣ Running the script from command prompt weren’t giving complete information.<br><br>

                      <b>• How did you overcome them?</b><br>
                      ‣‣‣ After initial research, I found out that only the domain name was to be given in the command
                      prompt.<br>
                      ‣‣‣ After checking online on Google, Youtube & other books, I found online tools such as DNS
                      Checker
                      - DNS Check Propagation Tool & https://www.nslookup.io/ to gather all information from a single
                      resource.<br><br>

                      <b>• How will they affect your final report?</b><br>
                      ‣‣‣ Performing this activity has helped me understand any website's critical details, such as
                      finding its digital address, aliases, servers where the website is hosted and the primary
                      registered contact. The information is crucial in performing a penetration test and can be
                      considered part of the enumeration phase in a traditional penetration testing methodology.

                    <b>1. What Operating System does the website utilise?</b><br>
                    • The Gin & Juice Shop is typically deployed on various operating systems, depending on its setup
                    environment. The current environment is using Oracle Virtualbox.<br><br>
                    <span id="dots2"></span>
                    <span id="more2">

                      <b>2. What web server software is it running?</b><br>
                      • It uses Node.js as its runtime environment and typically serves content via Express.js, a web
                      server framework.<br><br>

                      <b>3. Is it running a CMS (Wordpress, Drupal, etc?)</b><br>
                      • This site does not utilize a CMS like WordPress or Drupal. It is a custom application built as a
                      deliberately vulnerable web app for educational and training purposes.<br><br>

                      <b>4. What protection does it have (CDN, Proxy, Firewall?)</b><br>
                      • The website is intentionally designed without no protections to simulate
                      vulnerabilities.<br><br>

                      <b>5. Where is it hosted?</b><br>
                      • Juice Shop can be hosted locally or on cloud platforms. The current hosting for ginandjuice.shop
                      is hosted as per below details<br>
                      <b>Server:</b> 10.0.2.3<br>
                      <b>Address:</b> 10.0.2.3#53</b><br><br>

                      <b>6. Does it have any open ports? Which did you expect to be open?</b><br>
                      • The default port for the Juice Shop is 3000, though configurations may vary. For testing, this
                      is expected to be open to serve HTTP traffic.<br><br>

                      <b>7. Does the site have any known vulnerabilities?</b><br>
                      • Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities across the OWASP Top Ten, including injection flaws,
                      cross-site scripting (XSS), and security misconfigurations. It is purposefully designed as an
                      insecure web application for testing.</b><br><br>

                      <b>8. What versions of software is it using? Are these patched so that they are up to
                        date?</b><br>
                      • The application uses Node.js and libraries specified in its package.json. Versions vary
                      depending on the deployment, but security testing environments may not always use patched or
                      latest versions to preserve vulnerabilities for demonstration.<br><br>
