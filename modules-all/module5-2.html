                      <b>Introduction</b><br>
                     Human factors often underpin cybersecurity incidents, especially in resource-constrained startups (Khamrai, 2024). 
					 This essay critically examines three human-centric vulnerabilities, namely insider threat, lack of awareness and training,
					 and informal trust in unofficial processes, through the lens of KiranaPro. This Bangalore-based grocery delivery startup faced a destructive internal breach in June 2025 (Gusain, 2025).
					 The case highlights how startups, due to resource constraints, rapid growth, and informal governance are particularly vulnerable to human risks.
					 These factors will be examined with a focus on their implications, rather than solutions.<br><br>

                      <b>Insider threat: former employee wipes servers </b><br>
				Human factor explanation:<br>
				Insider threats occur when individuals with legitimate access, whether intentionally or unintentionally, compromise systems (Inayat et al., 2024). They exploit trust and privileges granted to them, often in environments lacking formal controls.<br>
				
KiranaPro incident: <br>
In early June 2025 KiranaPro suffered a catastrophic incident, an internal breach by a former employee who deleted critical server logs resulting in an operational halt and data loss (Tech Desk, 2025). Although customer data remained secure, the wipeout devastated their infrastructure.<br>
Critical analysis:<br>
In small startups, trust-based access often overrides security protocols (Brahme et al., 2025). Former employees retaining access is a glaring oversight, especially when monitoring and role-based revocation are not in place. This case aligns with Greitzer and Frincke (2010), who identify insider threats as socio-technical issues which stem from human privileges, role familiarity, and organisational gaps. For KiranaPro, a lack of access audits and offboarding processes enabled misuse, highlighting how insider threats are organisational failures as much as human ones.<br>
Implications: <br>
Operational disruption halted deliveries, resulting in reputational damage and potential financial loss. Investors may perceive such failures as governance weaknesses. Without structured access control, any disgruntled insider, even after departure, can cripple systems.
<br><br><br>

                      <b>Lack of awareness and training: unprepared staff</b><br>
					Human factor explanation:<br>
				Employee awareness and training equip staff to recognise and prevent security risks (Taherdoost,
2024). In startups, where technical and non-technical roles often overlap, awareness gaps can
lead to critical oversights.<br>
				
KiranaPro context: <br>
While the insider deletion was deliberate and internal, it was facilitated by staff untrained in
detecting risky behaviours or responding to internal incidents. The breach underscores that even
if external attacks are limited, staff still lacked vigilance toward internal misuse (TOI Lifestyle
Desk, 2025).<br>
Critical analysis:<br>
Small teams often deprioritise security training, believing incidents are unlikely. Research by
Bada et al., (2019) shows that the absence of training weakens institutional resilience. At
KiranaPro, the team had no protocols to verify or audit internal actions. Had there been rolebased
training or awareness of decision boundaries, they may have questioned or prevented
excessive log-clearing permissions.<br>
Implications: <br>
Without proper awareness, protocols can be overlooked. Employees may fail to notice anomalies
or inadequately secure internal systems, which can lead to systemic vulnerabilities (Shukla et al.,
2022). Even non-technical actions (like deleting files) become critical when no one questions
them.

them.
<br><br><br>

<b>Informal trust and process weakness: the role of culture</b><br>
					Human factor explanation:<br>
				Startups often rely on informal trust and verbal agreements over structured processes. While this
speeds innovation, it introduces risks by sidelining formal governance (Uchendu et al., 2021).<br>
				
KiranaPro scenario: <br>
CEO Deepak Ravindran initially believed the incident was external but later revealed that it
resulted from a former employee’s actions (TOI Tech Desk, 2025). This admitted misclassification
suggests a lack of awareness of internal processes and inadequate readiness for incident
response.<br>
Critical analysis:<br>
This reflects common startup culture, trusting internal actors without verification and lacking a
structured incident response or a transparent chain of command. Such environments normalise
or increase the chances of risk. As Parsons et al. (2017) observe, organisational culture
profoundly shapes individual behaviour. If cleanup permissions are casually granted and not
logged, misuse can be easily possible. KiranaPro’s informal governance allowed a single
individual to have unsupervised access to critical systems.<br>
Implications: <br>
Ad hoc trust increases the risk of operational sabotage, not only malicious but also accidental.
Without clear policies, roles, and separation of duties, the startup culture itself becomes a high level vulnerability.<br>
<br><br>


<b>Conclusion</b><br>
The KiranaPro case exemplifies how small startups are vulnerable not just to external attacks but also internal human factors. Three interrelated issues enabled the insider deletion event are: <br>
1.
Insider threat enabled by leftover access privileges.<br>
2.
Lack of awareness and training left staff unprepared.<br>
3.
Overreliance on informal trust and processes that bypassed checks and balances.<br>
Each factor underscores how human behaviour and organisational culture are integral to cybersecurity (Khadka and Ullah, 2025). Unlike purely technical threats, these vulnerabilities arise from social and process deficiencies. Startups must critically understand these dynamics even in the absence of proposed solutions to build resilient socio-technical systems that are compatible with rapid growth and limited resources.<br>
