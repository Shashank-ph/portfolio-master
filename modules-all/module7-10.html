                    <b>What: Describing the Learning Experience</b><br> Throughout this module, I engaged in a variety
                    of activities that shaped my understanding of computing research, statistical analysis, and
                    professional development. In Collaborative Discussion 1, I posted an initial response on generative
                    AI ethics, responded to peers, and summarised key insights, fostering critical thinking about AI
                    governance. Reflective Activity 1 deepened this by prompting a written reflection on ethical
                    considerations in generative AI, highlighting issues like bias and accountability. In Unit 3, I
                    drafted outlines for my Literature Review and Research Proposal, focusing on enhancing cyberbullying
                    detection through hybrid machine learning models. This was refined in Unit 4 through a peer-reviewed
                    Research Proposal outline, which emphasised multimodal and ethical approaches to social media
                    analysis. Collaborative Discussion 2 further honed my ability to articulate and critique research
                    ideas collaboratively.

                    <span id="more">

                      Statistical exercises were central to my learning. The Seminar 4 Inferential Statistics Workshop
                      and associated worksheet introduced me to statistical tools and concepts like hypothesis testing
                      and regression analysis. I also completed Statistical Worksheet Submissions and a Charts Example
                      Worksheet, which required applying statistical methods to real-world data. These tasks challenged
                      my analytical skills but were pivotal in building confidence. Finally, Seminar 6: e-Portfolio
                      Preparation guided me in collating my work, including a SWOT analysis, to reflect on my
                      professional growth. These activities collectively addressed the module’s learning outcomes,
                      particularly appraising ethical issues, academic investigation principles, and research
                      methodology.<br><br>

                      <b>So What: Analysing Emotions, Behaviour, and Impact</b><br>
                      The module was both challenging and rewarding, eliciting a range of emotions that shaped my
                      learning. Initially, the Collaborative Discussion 1 and Reflective Activity 1 on AI ethics felt
                      overwhelming due to the complexity of ethical dilemmas in computing. I felt uncertain about
                      balancing innovation with accountability, but engaging with peers’ perspectives helped me clarify
                      my stance. Referencing Floridi (2019), I realised that ethical frameworks must evolve with AI
                      advancements, which shifted my perspective from apprehension to curiosity. This emotional journey
                      encouraged me to approach ethical discussions with greater openness, enhancing my critical
                      thinking.<br><br>

                      The statistical exercises, particularly in Seminar 4 and the Statistical Worksheet Submissions,
                      were initially daunting. My limited knowledge and prior experience with inferential statistics led
                      to frustration when interpreting p-values and confidence intervals. However, testing and
                      completing the Charts Example Worksheet and visualising data trends boosted my confidence.
                      According to Field (2018), practical application is key to mastering statistical concepts, and
                      this resonated with my experience. The iterative process of trial and error taught me resilience,
                      as I sought additional resources, such as online tutorials, to bridge knowledge gaps. This
                      persistence directly improved my analytical outputs, as evidenced by more accurate worksheet
                      submissions.<br><br>

                      The Literature Review and Research Proposal tasks in Units 3 and 4 were intellectually stimulating
                      but exposed my weakness in structuring academic arguments. Feedback from peers during
                      Collaborative Discussion 2 highlighted areas for improvement, such as clarifying research
                      objectives. This feedback, while initially disheartening, motivated me to refine my proposal on
                      cyberbullying detection. The process underscored the importance of iterative refinement in
                      research, aligning with Saunders et al. (2019), who emphasise the role of feedback in robust
                      research design.<br><br>

                      Reflecting on my SWOT analysis from Seminar 6, I identified strengths in collaboration and
                      critical thinking, but recognised time management as a weakness. The pressure to balance multiple
                      tasks led to rushed submissions early in the module, affecting quality. However, creating an
                      action plan helped me prioritise tasks, resulting in a more structured e-Portfolio. This process
                      made me more self-aware, aligning with Rolfe et al.’s (2001) emphasis on critical self-reflection
                      for professional growth.<br><br>

                      <b>Now What: Applying Learning to Future Contexts</b><br>
                      The module has significantly shaped my academic and professional trajectory. My improved
                      statistical analysis skills, developed through seminars and worksheet submissions, will be
                      invaluable in my career as a computing professional. For instance, I can apply regression analysis
                      to evaluate user data in cybersecurity projects, ensuring evidence-based decisions. This aligns
                      with the module’s learning outcome of evaluating research methodologies, as I now appreciate the
                      importance of robust data analysis in validating research findings.<br><br>

                      The research methods process, particularly through the Literature Review and Research Proposal,
                      has equipped me to approach academic investigations systematically. My proposal on cyberbullying
                      detection highlighted the need for ethical considerations in AI-driven solutions, a principle I
                      will carry into future projects. Drawing on Miteu (2024), I plan to integrate ethical frameworks
                      into my research designs to ensure social responsibility in technology development. This addresses
                      the learning outcome of appraising ethical issues in computing.<br><br>

                      Professionally, the SWOT analysis and action plan have clarified my development goals. I aim to
                      improve time management by adopting tools like Trello for project planning, which will enhance my
                      efficiency in collaborative settings. The collaborative discussions taught me the value of diverse
                      perspectives, which I will apply in team-based projects to foster inclusive decision-making.
                      According to Bansal et al. (2019), effective collaboration is critical in research, and I intend
                      to leverage this in future group endeavours.<br><br>

                      The module also reinforced the importance of academic integrity. Using Harvard referencing
                      correctly, as guided by the University of Essex Online, ensured I acknowledged others’ work
                      appropriately, a practice I will maintain to uphold professional standards. The Turnitin
                      Originality Check process further instilled a habit of verifying citations, which I will continue
                      to ensure ethical scholarship.<br><br>

                      In conclusion, this module has been transformative, enhancing my statistical, research, and
                      reflective skills. The challenges I faced, whether grappling with statistics or refining my
                      research proposal, have fostered resilience and critical thinking. Moving forward, I will apply
                      these skills to real-world computing challenges, particularly in ethical AI and cybersecurity,
                      ensuring my work is both technically sound and socially responsible. The structured reflection
                      process, inspired by Rolfe et al. (2001), has provided a framework to evaluate and improve my
                      practice continuously, ensuring lifelong learning and professional growth.<br><br>
